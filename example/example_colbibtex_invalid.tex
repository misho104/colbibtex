\section*{Invalid ``colbibtex'' example}
One may wrongly use the entry already collapsed in its bare form, like
\begin{quote}
  The Higgs boson, so-called after Ref.~\cite{Higgs:1964pj}, is discovered in 2012 at the LHC~\cite{HiggsDiscovery}.
  The paper by ATLAS collaboration~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} was posted on arXiv at 11:59:59~GMT on 31 July, while that by CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} was at 13:27:18~GMT.
  The particle is proposed in, e.g., Refs.~\cite{Higgs:1964pj,Englert:1964et}.
\end{quote}
In this case, both ``collapsed'' and ''pure'' entries appear.
\TODO{colbibtex should raise warnings.}
