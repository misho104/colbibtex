\section*{``colbibtex'' example}
\begin{quote}
The Higgs boson is discovered in 2012 at the LHC~\cite{HiggsDiscovery}.
\end{quote}

This is an example with \href{https://github.com/misho104/colbibtex}{\emph{colbibtex}} script.
We added a \texttt{@collapse} entry in the \texttt{.bib} file.
Then the \TeX\ source is simpler and you do not have to cut-and-paste the \texttt{\\cite} command from your old works.
Meanwhile, \texttt{.bst} file should be modified\footnote{%
  You can just use the file \texttt{utphys27mod(\_wotitle).bst} included in this example.
}, and the compile is a bit complicated:
\begin{lstlisting}
pdflatex example_colbibtex
colbibtex example_colbibtex
pdflatex example_colbibtex
pdflatex example_colbibtex
\end{lstlisting}
or
\begin{lstlisting}
latexmk -e "\$bibtex='colbibtex'" example_colbibtex
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{An invalid case}
One may wrongly use the entry already collapsed in its bare form, like
\begin{quote}
The Higgs boson is discovered in 2012 at the LHC~\cite{HiggsDiscovery}.
The paper by ATLAS collaboration~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} was posted on arXiv at 11:59:59~GMT on 31 July, while that by CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} was at 13:27:18~GMT.
\end{quote}
In this case, both ``bared'' entry remain as \texttt{[?]} because it is already used in the collapsed entry.
\TODO{colbibtex should raise warnings.}
